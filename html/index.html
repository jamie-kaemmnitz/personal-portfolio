    <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Hi my names Jamie, I have been working in the construction industry for the last 10 years and decided to take a new career path as a front end developer. 
        I am currently in the final stages of my front end plus course. I am a hard worker who is always looking to expand my knowledge on my field of work. 
        I have been practicing my new skills on some personal projects which can be viewed in the projects section.</p>
