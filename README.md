My Personal Portfolio
=================================================================
Project description
-------------------
As part of my Codecademy FrontEndPlus course i was tasked with designed a personal portfolio web page for myself.

The project consists of a HTML page, a CSS styling page and a small Javascript page. The Html consists of 5 sections, the home screen which is show first an about section, a skills section showing the different languages and tools i have learnt, a project section showcasing the projects i have completed and a contact section with details how to contact me.

In the projects section i have a title of the project and an image of the home screen of the project, in laptop or computer browsers there is a hover event where the picture will grow in size with a click here to open project message, on mobiles and tablet the caption is already viewable.
If the titles of the projects are blue there is a link to th readme section which is available on click. All anchors in the project section open a new tab.

There is a nav header at the top which allows for easy access to the sections.


How to Install and Run
----------------------
You can download the code by clicking the green code button and copying the link in the box, i worked on this project with VS Code, i believe this should be transferable to other software. You can also run the webpage by entering the following link into your browser - https://jamie-kaemmnitz.github.io/personal-portfolio/
